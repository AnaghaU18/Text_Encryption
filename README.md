# Text_Encryption
This is a cybersecurity project that encrypts text using different algorithms like AES, DES and RSA for secure data protection.

The project includes 3 encryption modules (AES, DES, RSA), each implementing the respective cryptographic technique, and a main module that combines the whole project by importing the 3 encryption modules.
